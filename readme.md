Aim of this project is to make an implementation of the DBSCAN (Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm.



This git repository consists of 2 seperate parts:
	
	- Implemenation of the algorithm using C language
	
	- A Python API for the algorithm which is compatible with numpy library


The paper that have been used as reference for definitions and algorithm itself is the following:

Ester, M., Kriegel, H.-P., Sander, J., Xu, X., & others. (1996). A density-based algorithm for discovering clusters in large spatial databases with noise. In kdd (Vol. 96, pp. 226â€“231).
